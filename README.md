## Inspiration

The traditional invoice financing model is plagued with inefficiencies, high costs, and a lack of transparency. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to revolutionize this model, introducing a decentralized platform that streamlines the invoice financing process. Our platform ensures security, transparency, and efficiency for all parties involved, providing a secure environment for invoice financing.

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi), our platform emerges as a groundbreaking solution, revolutionizing the traditional invoice financing model. By leveraging blockchain technology, we introduce a DeFi platform that facilitates invoice financing through a decentralized market-making approach, ensuring security, transparency, and efficiency for all parties involved.

Our platform integrates four key personas, each playing a pivotal role in the invoice financing ecosystem:

1. **Insurance Enterprise**: Acts as guarantor and the market facilitator, providing a foundational layer of trust and security. The Insurance Enterprise commits a USDC (USD Coin) amount as a guarantee, fostering a secure environment for transactions within the platform. This guarantee is pivotal for market creation and instills confidence among other participants.
2. **Seller (Manufacturer or Service Provider)**: Responsible for raising invoices for goods or services delivered to the buyer. The Seller benefits from immediate liquidity by receiving a substantial portion of the invoice value upfront, enhancing their cash flow and operational efficiency.
3. **Buyer**: Obligated to acknowledge and accept the validity of the invoices raised by the Seller. Upon due dates, the Buyer fulfills their financial commitment by paying the full invoice amount. This role is crucial in maintaining the integrity and reliability of the transaction cycle. In addition, the Buyer gains the benefit of trading with a healthy (cash-flow-wise) supply chain, and also a platform whereby they can dispute invoices.
4. **P2P Investor**: Provides the financial backbone for the invoices by investing in them. They finance 95% of the invoice value and, in return, receive their investment back with a stable yield upon invoice maturity. This opens a new avenue for investors seeking opportunities in the DeFi space.

1. **Market Channel Creation**: Following the guarantee placement by the Insurance Enterprise, the platform creates a unique private market channel. This channel permits the trading of invoices up to the value of the guarantee amount. It forms the core of our platform, where invoice financing transactions are securely processed.
2. **Enterprise Onboarding and Invoice Initiation**: The Insurance Enterprise vets and approves enterprises to participate in the market channel. Once onboarded, a Seller can initiate an invoice process by uploading an invoice to the platform. The invoice remains pending until accepted by the Buyer.
3. **Invoice Validation and Acceptance**: The Buyer reviews and validates the invoice submitted by the Seller. Upon confirmation of its validity, the Buyer accepts the invoice, triggering its listing on the platform as available for financing.
4. **Investment and Financing**: P2P investors browse the available invoices on the platform and select those they wish to finance. By investing, they provide 95% of the invoice value in USDC, which is immediately transferred to the Sellerâ€™s wallet, thus ensuring the Seller's immediate liquidity needs are met.
5. **Invoice Settlement and Return Distribution**: When the invoice reaches its due date, the Buyer completes the payment of the full invoice value. Subsequently, the platform processes the returns where 95% of the invoice value plus a 4% stable yield is directed back to the investors. Additionally, a 1% service fee is allocated to the Insurance Enterprise for their role in stabilizing and securing the market.
